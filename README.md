This repo contains the official implementation for the paper "SplatFields: Neural Gaussian Splats for Sparse 3D and 4D Reconstruction". 
SplatFields regularizes 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [29] by predicting the splat features and locations via neural fields to improve the reconstruction under unconstrained sparse views. 

Our approach effectively handles static and dynamic scenes.
